# VBA-Challenge
#while looking for a starting point i googled stockmarket vba and found this https://github.com/DataTell/VBA-Challenge/blame/master/VBAStocks/VBAStocksScript.bas  which has a lot of code i used.  I am not a excel or a vba person.  So I leaned heavily on the borrowed code.  I feel a bit better going into python since i programming languages a bit better than vb.  Previous job i used wise script and powershell.  Hopefully this is not plagrism as i borrowed and not said it is my own.  If it is, i will unsubmit my code here.  I learn from seeing it and stepping through the code, blank screen i am not certain where to start other than declaring variables.  This is my first stab at git hub as well, bare with me.
